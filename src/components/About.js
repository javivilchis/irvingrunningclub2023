            <p className="fs-3">The Irving Running Club was founded in October 2012 so that like-minded people in the area could enjoy the camaraderie and support of each other, meet new people, train for goals and learn more about running/racing, get fit/fitter, and showcase and enjoy the beautiful trails of the City of Irving.</p>
<p className="fs-3">
The Irving Running Club (IRC) is free and welcomes runners from all over and of all experience levels. We have runners who are training to run their first mile, those who are training to win first place overall in a marathon, those who are training for their second or third 125+ mile race, and everything in between. We would love to see you out at a run!</p>
